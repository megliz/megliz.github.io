                       Grayrock Cottage - David and Diana Eller <br>
                       In recent years, David and Diana Eller have studied under several master potters and with that knowledge, have grown to love the process of taking clay and giving it a new life as a useful ware. As potters, it is their mission to maintain the integrity of the art of pot-making, to produce wares that were made with a passion for the process and with an end result that is reflective of that passion.

                       A Bit off Center - Julie Rogers and Rae Brown <br>
                        Julie Rogers and Rae Brown create functional ceramics in their home studios located in Winterville, North Carolina. Their pieces begin on the potter’s wheel; then they are altered, glazed by hand, and fired to 2200 degrees to produce pots that are safe for use in the microwave, dishwasher, and oven.

                       Peace Pottery - Tracy Becker <br>
                       Statesville resident, Tracy Becker, doesn’t use a pottery wheel therefore, she makes every piece by hand so each one is completely unique and imperfect. She uses the name, Peace Pottery, because she feels at peace when creating her pottery and signs each of her creations with a symbol from an ancient language that means Peacefulness and Love.
